# Overview

## What is SDSA?

SDSA (Spatial Data Search Assistant) is a server-based application designed to facilitate the development of an advanced search system for geospatial data. Leveraging cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs), it enables a search capability that surpasses conventional methods found in metadata catalogs. The application features four essential modules, each fulfilling distinct functions crucial for delivering high-quality retrieval:

- Indexing Module
- Retrieval Module
- Search Criteria Module
- Answer Generation Module

These modules collectively empower SDSA to efficiently index, retrieve, apply search criteria, and generate accurate answers, thereby enhancing the overall search experience for geospatial data.
